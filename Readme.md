# ATTENTION: GloSC is currently being rewritten, and renamed to GlosSI ([Glo]bal ([s]ystemwide) [S]team [I]nput)

No ETA when it's done  
No support until then.  

**Looking for contributors!**  
As the past has shown, I have way to less time on hand too maintain such a project.  
Reach out via Discord/E-Mail (But get to the point right away, please, I get way too much spam)  

See: [BUILDING.md](./docs/BUILDING.md),[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

# GlosSI

GlosSI or [Glo]bal ([s]ystemwide) [S]team [I]nput, formerly knows as GloSC (Global Steam Controller), is a tool that allows one to use Steam-Input controller rebinding at a system-level alongside a system wide (borderless window) Steam overlay  
All complete with **per application bindings and working rumble emulation.**  
GlosSI can, but isn't required to, launch any of your favorite games or applications and directly add them to Steam, be it Win32 or Windows Store (UWP)!  
It is **the tool** to enjoy any game that has trouble with Steam and/or *add extra functionality* to your Steam-Input needs  

*Windows Store*, *Reshade / SweetFX*, *Origin*, *Uplay*, *Emulators* and *more* with **no hassle**â„¢

---

## How does it work? / What does it do?

GlosSI creates and adds a (or multiple) non-Steam shortcuts to Steam. When one of those is launched, a transparent, borderless window appears in which you can use the Steam-overlay. You also get access to touch- and radial-menus and other functionality normally only present in Games

In addition to that, Gamecontroller-inputs are redirected to the whole operating system, so that they will work with any game or application  
Real Gamecontrollers are hidden from other applications, so that they can't interfere with your game.

This brings full Steam-Input functionality to the desktop and any other application Steam-Input might not have worked before

Games do not need to be launched using GlosSI.  
If the "Start Application" option does not work, launch any GlosSI-Shortcut from Steam, followed by a game or application. 

## How do you use it?

1. Install Steam (it's needed even if your game is on Game Pass or Battle.net or any other such source)
2. Download the newest GlosSI build and install vc_redist.x64 & ViGEmBusSetup_x64 from its folder
3. Open GlosSIConfig, click on + and choose the type of game you want (like UWP for Game Pass games from the Microsoft Store)
4. Click on the game's Steam icon in the GlosSI main menu to add the configured game to your Steam Library as a shortcut
5. Restart Steam
6. Start the game from the Steam Library, if all is well it will also trigger a terminal window with what GlosSI is doing

## What this is not

- a replacement for Steams controller configuration tool.
- a Steam remote play / steam game streaming solution. (That being said, it **can** work, but is not guaranteed to.)
- Old versions (GloSC, Global [S]team[C]ontroller) where never designed to be used with anything other than said controller, GlosSI can be used with any controller.

## GlosSI consists of

- The "GlosSITarget" which does most of the magic - Showing the overlay to the user as well as talking to the ViGEm-driver for system wide Controller emulation
- A config application ("GlosSIConfig") handling shortcut ("GlosSITarget") creation and their addition to Steam.

GloSC got mentioned from Valve in the [Steam client beta change log on the 9. of January](https://twitter.com/flatspotpics/status/818697837055770624)

GloSC/GlosSI is not affiliated with Valve, Steam, or any of their partners.

---

GlosSI is built using [Qt 6.2](https://www.qt.io/) and a fork of [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) for drawing the overlay

The system wide Xbox-Controller works via [ViGEm](https://vigem.org/projects/ViGEm/)
Device Hiding via [HidHide](https://vigem.org/projects/HidHide/)
